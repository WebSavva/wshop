# W-SHOP E-commerce app
 The app manifests itself an ordinary e-commerce MERN single page application where different sorts of digital devices and equipment can be purchased. All in all, the [following tutorial](https://github.com/bradtraversy/proshop_mern) was the initial inspiration. But to make a full copy of the original app was not exciting. That is why I attempted to build up my own version of that e-commerce app. 

 ## Sidenote
 > The   quality of the source code is extremely poor in some aspects and utilizes the least reasonable ways to solve a problem. Many of these shortcomings were partially removed in my project so that the project would be more maintainable further down the road as the code base grows bigger. 

 ### Used Technologies
 * React
 * React Router
 * TypeScript (the whole frontend is written in TypeScript)
 * Express.js (API is built upon that framework)
 * Authentication via JSON Web Token
 * Mongoose (to interact with MongoDB)
 * React Bootstrap (that technology was used with only one purpose: to give the website a nice look)
 * Create React App (to bundle up the final project)
 * Paypal API (to enable customers to make payments for products)

 ### Features
 * Adaptive pagination of the page with listed products
 * Admin page where almost all data stored in the database can be modified
 * Session saving enabled by Local Storage API
 * Form validation implemented from scratch
 * Ability to search products by name
 * Shopping Cart
 * Animated process of order placement
 * Fully responsive design
 * Ability to leave review for a certain product and also rate it
